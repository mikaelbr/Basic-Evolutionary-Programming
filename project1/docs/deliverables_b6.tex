\section{Coevolution}

I've seen, that in a co-evolution, one can't just look at the fitness to assess the strength of
the solution. The max fitness value varied radically from generation to generation. In other 
implementations, non co-evolution, one could se a gradually increase in strength as the
generations passed. Typically in a staircase shape. This is not the case for competitive 
co-evolution. \\

Instead of looking at the fitness one could other measures to find the strength of a solution.
In this case I used the entropy function $H(s)$. This value helped indicate if the strategy was
a smart one or not. \\
