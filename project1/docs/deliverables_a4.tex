\section{Selection mechanism with the best results}
By holding the population size at a massive 200, and number of generations at 100, with crossover
probability 90\% and uniform, I tried different selection mechanisms for the EA. 

Straight away there were massive changes. The first mechanism I tried was SigmaScaling. Only after
around 20 generations a consistent solution across the population was found. Several testruns were tried
and it had massive advandages every time. As seen in \autoref{fig:onemax-6}, the evolution still has what
seems like a good convergance, in a stair shaped increase over generations.

Also Tournament selection mechanism has a high advantage from the fitness-proportionate. By still using
the same parameters the tournament mechanism found a solution within 40 generations. This mechanism
was a bit more inconsistent and varied more than Sigma Scaling.

As seen from both the tournament run and sigma scaling, both parent selection mechanisms have greatly
increased the performance of the One-Max problem runs.
