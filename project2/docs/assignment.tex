\section{About the project}


\textbf{Purpose}: Gain hands-on experience both a) evolving parameters 
for a single neuron, and b) quantitatively comparing neural spike trains.

I'll use my previously developed EA algorithm to evolve parameters for a
single artificial neuron, based on a model by Eugene Izhikevich. 

There are two aspects to this project: Implementing the Izhikevich model,
and calculating the distance between two spike trains.
