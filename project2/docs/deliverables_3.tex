\section{Genotype-Phenotype Mapping}

We have the genotype, which represents each of the parameters. The parameters
again is used to calculate the phenotype. Thus, there is no direct interpretations
from the genotype to the phenotype. \\

We have a sett of relatively small values as genotype, and we convert them to an
array of length $timestep$ (in our case 1000).
