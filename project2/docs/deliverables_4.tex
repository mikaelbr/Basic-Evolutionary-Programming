\section{Practical Implications}

This system can be used to reproduce and find the mathematical formula
for simulating signals from neurons. So if a neuro-scientist uses this algorithm, 
sending in real data from a test, he/she could get the neccesery parameters to
reproduce the result, mathematicly. This way a simulator can be built to test 
different implications of these signals, and so on.
